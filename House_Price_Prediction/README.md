🎓 Internship

Oasis Infobyte Internship Program (OIBSIP)
Level 2 – Data Analytics / Machine Learning Task

📌 Project Title

Predicting House Prices using Linear Regression

🎯 Objective

To build a Machine Learning model using Linear Regression to predict house prices based on various features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other property attributes.

The goal is to understand how different factors influence housing prices and develop a predictive model for real estate valuation.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains housing-related features such as:

Area (Square Feet)

Number of Bedrooms

Number of Bathrooms

Location-based attributes

Price (Target Variable)

The dataset was used to train and evaluate a regression model for price prediction.

🧹 Data Preprocessing Steps

Checked and handled missing values

Encoded categorical variables

Feature selection

Data scaling (if required)

Split dataset into training and testing sets

🤖 Model Implementation

Applied Linear Regression Algorithm

Trained the model using training data

Predicted house prices on test data
