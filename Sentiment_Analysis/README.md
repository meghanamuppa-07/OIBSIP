📌 Project Title

Sentiment Analysis Using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

🎯 Objective

To analyze textual data and determine the sentiment (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) using Natural Language Processing techniques.

The goal is to extract meaningful insights from text data and understand public opinion, customer feedback, or user emotions using data analytics and visualization techniques.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

NLTK

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
