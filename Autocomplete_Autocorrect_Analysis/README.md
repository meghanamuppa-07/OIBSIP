Level 2 – Data Analytics / NLP Project

📌 Project Title

Autocomplete and Autocorrect System using NLP Techniques

🎯 Objective

To analyze and implement Autocomplete and Autocorrect mechanisms using Natural Language Processing techniques in order to enhance text prediction accuracy and improve user experience.

The project focuses on building predictive text models using text data and evaluating their performance.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

NLTK

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains textual data used for:

Word frequency analysis

Phrase prediction

Text pattern learning

The dataset was preprocessed before implementing predictive algorithms.

🧹 Data Preprocessing Steps

Text cleaning (lowercasing, punctuation removal)

Tokenization

Stopword removal

Frequency distribution analysis

N-gram generation

Text normalization

🤖 Model Implementation
🔹 Autocomplete:

Implemented N-gram model

Predicted next word based on previous words

Frequency-based word suggestion

🔹 Autocorrect:

Used edit distance logic

Compared misspelled words with dictionary

Suggested closest matching words

📊 Evaluation Metrics

Prediction Accuracy

Suggestion Frequency

Response Efficiency

📈 Key Insights
