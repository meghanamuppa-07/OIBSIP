💳 Fraud Detection – OIBSIP Level 2
🎓 Internship

Oasis Infobyte Internship Program (OIBSIP)
Level 2 – Data Analytics / Machine Learning Task

📌 Project Title

Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

🎯 Objective

To build a machine learning model capable of detecting fraudulent transactions based on transaction-related features.

The goal is to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate, helping financial institutions reduce risk and improve security.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset Information

The dataset contains transaction-related features including:

Transaction time

Transaction amount

Anonymized features (V1, V2, … V28)

Class (0 = Legitimate, 1 = Fraud)

The dataset is highly imbalanced, making fraud detection a challenging classification problem.

🧹 Data Preprocessing Steps

Checked and handled missing values

Analyzed class imbalance

Feature scaling

Train-Test split

Data balancing techniques (if applied)

🤖 Models Implemented

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

📊 Model Evaluation

Evaluated performance using:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Special focus was given to Recall, as detecting fraud is more critical than overall accuracy.

📈 Key Insights

Identified imbalance in fraud vs non-fraud transactions

Random Forest achieved better fraud detection performance

Highlighted importance of recall in fraud detection systems

Demonstrated practical understanding of anomaly detection

📉 Visualizations Included

Class Distribution Plot

Correlation Heatmap

Confusion Matrix Visualization

Feature Importance Plot
